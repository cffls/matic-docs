Filecoin is built on top of IPFS and supports storing data long-term via on-chain deals. Together, they help us break free from centralized services while conveniently allowing us to enjoy the same luxuries of speed and guaranteed storage that centralized services would bring.

## Storage Helpers (IPFS + Filecoin)

- [Estuary](https://estuary.tech): Pinning service that stores and retrieves data on both IPFS and Filecoin networks via simple API calls ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHAMHbpioGw))

- [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage): NFT storage service that stores and retrieves data relating to NFTs on IPFS and Filecoin ([video](https://youtu.be/Ckb4RRJo-W0))

- [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage): Data storage service that stores and retrieves data on IPFS and Filecoin ([video](https://youtu.be/lPEqg6oL3Nk))

- [Textile Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/): Highly configurable wrapper for IPFS+Filecoin inside a Docker container, with bridges Polygon, and other smart contract networks

- [Fleek Space Daemon and Space SDK](https://fleek.co/space-sdk/): For decentralized browser, mobile, or desktop development

## Filecoin - Polygon Bridge

- Textile is building a [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) Bridge to the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network. Filecoin brings many of the best parts of the [IPFS stack](https://ipfs.io/), including verifiable data, peer-to-peer (p2p) data exchange, de-duplication, and more. We can create a more secure data storage layer for Polygon applications and their users by bridging the Filecoin and Polygon blockchains.Please refer this [link](https://blog.textile.io/filecoin-polygon-bridge-release/) and if you want to know how you can setup with polygon please refer [this](https://eth.storage/docs).
