`withdrawExitFaster` method can be used to exit the withdraw process by using the txHash from `withdrawStart` method.

 class="highlight mb-20px mt-20px">
It is fast because it generates proof in backend. You need to configure [setProofAPI](/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/matic-js/set-proof-api).
>

**Note**- withdrawStart transaction must be checkpointed in order to exit the withdraw.

```
const erc721RootToken = posClient.erc721(<root token address>, true);

const result = await erc721RootToken.withdrawExitFaster(<burn tx hash>);

const txHash = await result.getTransactionHash();

const txReceipt = await result.getReceipt();

```
